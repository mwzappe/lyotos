LyotOS -- The Lyot Optical Simulator

LyotOS sprung out of some work I was doing with lens antennas, some
frustrations I had with other optical simulation programs out there,
and my general desire to work through things from first principles.

This is nowhere near complete, and is in the middle of a rewrite, so
there's no version number or anything as of now.
